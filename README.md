# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built with Streamlit, using TMDB dataset and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions.

# Features

-Content-Based Recommendations: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find similar movies
-Interactive UI: Modern Streamlit interface with movie posters and metadata
-Search Functionality: Search for specific movies in the database
-Genre Filtering: Filter movies by genre for better discovery
-Rich Movie Cards: Display ratings, release year, and overview
-API Caching: Efficient poster loading with LRU cache
-Error Handling: Robust error handling for API failures and missing data

# Technology Stack

-Frontend: Streamlit
-Backend: Python
-Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
-Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
-External API: TMDB (The Movie Database)
-Caching: functools.lru_cache

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TMDB API key (get one from [TMDB API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/yasinhusenwako/Movie_Recommendation_System.git>
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
```

2.  Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your TMDB API key
TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_tmdb_api_key_here
```

4. Download Required Data Files

The TMDB dataset files are too large for GitHub. Download them from:

- [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
  - Download `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
  - Place both files in the project directory

5.  Generate Processed Data Files

Run the data processing script to create the required pickle files:

```bash
python generate_data.py
```

This will create:

- `movie_dict.pkl` - Processed movie data with tags
- `cosine_sim.pkl` - Cosine similarity matrix for recommendations

6. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

# Data Processing

The system processes movie data through the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Load TMDB movies and credits datasets
2. Feature Engineering: Combine genres, keywords, cast (top 3), and director
3. Text Processing: Create tags by joining all features
4. Vectorization: Apply TF-IDF vectorization to movie tags
5. Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity matrix
6. Storage: Save processed data as pickle files

# How It Works

1. Movie Selection: User selects a movie from the dropdown or searches for one
2. Similarity Calculation: System finds movies with similar content features
3. Recommendation Display: Shows top 10 most similar movies with posters and metadata
4. Interactive Features: Users can search and filter by genre

# Configuration

# Environment Variables

- `TMDB_API_KEY`: Your TMDB API key for fetching movie posters

# Troubleshooting

# Common Issues

1. Missing Data Files

   - Ensure `movie_dict.pkl` and `cosine_sim.pkl` exist
   - Run the notebook to regenerate them if needed

2. API Key Issues

   - Verify your TMDB API key is valid
   - Check that it's properly set in environment variables

3. Poster Loading Errors

   - Some movies may not have posters available
   - The system gracefully handles missing posters

4. Memory Issues
   - The application uses caching to optimize performance
   - Large datasets may require more RAM
